# godefarig
spherical terrain generator

The aim of this project is to experiment with procedural generation in order to create a system of planet creation.

# current state

It is currently able to create elevation and coloration on the cpu side.
It uses an octahedral base, each triangular face being divised into four smaller triangles at each iteration.

# long term goals

- perform calculations on the GPU
- add a subduction/erosion mecanism to generate the elevations
